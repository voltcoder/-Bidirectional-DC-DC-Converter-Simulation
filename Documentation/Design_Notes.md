# Design Notes - Bidirectional DC-DC Converter

This document is a placeholder for design notes describing:
- Converter topology (e.g., full-bridge bidirectional)
- Control strategy (e.g., PWM for buck/boost, current control loop)
- Protection and monitoring (overcurrent, overvoltage)
- Test plan and expected results
